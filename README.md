Customer Churn Analysis as a part of the
#Mavenchurnchallenge by Maven Analytics.

Customers churn all the time! Here is a fictional telecom company (named Maven Telecom or MT here) facing the same issue. The Customer Churn dataset contained information on 7,043 customers from California in Q2 2022. This was a rich dataset with a lot of possible graphs and trends. The effort was to show a simple uncluttered dashboard.  

Insights-

	1. Problem? Customer churning.
	2. Why is it happening? Biggest reasons include competitor's better device, and their better offers. Moreover, the attitude of MT's customer support reps is not at par.
	3. What is the overall churn impact? MT is losing 17.28% of revenue because of the churn (almost 3.6 Mil) . Also, MT's Quarterly churn rate is 28% without including the newly joined.
	4. Any info on customer behavior? 64% of the people who churn do it before an average of 18 months. Internet downloads is prominent with younger age group (below 30). Most of the people are not spending on MT's offers. 
	5. What can be done? Need market research to understand competitor's device and improve MT's offerings. Train customer service rep and deep dive to understand root cause (long working hours? Poor comp structure? Poor management causing frustration? It can be anything) . Analyze MT's offers and understand value proposition against competitor's offers. Most of the people (approx. 5k) use both internet and phone services, hence to increase the revenue  MT can look into charging 3rd party streaming of Movie, Music, and TV.
	6. Extra- Implementation of ML algorithm for predicting if customer will churn or stay: 81% accuracy.
